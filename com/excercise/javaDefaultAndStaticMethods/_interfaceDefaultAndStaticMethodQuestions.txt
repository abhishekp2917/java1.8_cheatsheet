*   What is default method in interface ?

>>  A default method in an interface is a method that provides a default implementation within the interface itself. Before 
    Java 8, interfaces could only declare method signatures, requiring implementing classes to provide the method's 
    implementation. However, default methods allow interfaces to have method implementations.

    Here's an example:

    ```
        public interface MyInterface {
            // Regular method declaration without implementation
            void regularMethod(); 

            default void defaultMethod() {
                // Default implementation provided here
                System.out.println("This is a default implementation");
            }
        }
    ```
    
    Classes implementing MyInterface can choose to override the default method or use it as is. If 
    they don't override the default method, the interface's default implementation will be used.

*   Why there is a need of default method in interface ?

>>  Default methods in Java interfaces serve a few important purposes:

    (1) Backward compatibility: 
    
        They allow interfaces to evolve without breaking the implementing classes. Prior to Java 8, adding new methods 
        to an interface would break all classes implementing that interface unless they were updated to provide an 
        implementation for the new method. Default methods prevent this issue by offering a default implementation, 
        allowing existing code to function without modifications.


    (2) Code maintenance: 
    
        Default methods reduce redundancy by providing a default implementation that can be shared among multiple classes 
        implementing the interface. This can help minimize code duplication and streamline development.

*   Does method overriding and overloading applies to default method ?

>>  Yes, method overriding and overloading applies to default method.

*   What will happen if a class implements 2 interfaces which has default method of same method signature ?

>>  If a class implements two interfaces that have default methods with the same signature, the class must override the 
    method explicitly to provide its own implementation.

    For instance, let's say there is InterfaceA and InterfaceB having same default method sayHello()

    ```
        interface InterfaceA {
            default void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hello from InterfaceA");
            }
        }

        interface InterfaceB {
            default void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hello from InterfaceB");
            }
        }
    ```

    Here, as implementing class implements both the interface, it arise a conflict. It can be resolved by overriding the 
    default method 
    
        ```
            class MyClass implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {
                // Conflict arises here as both interfaces provide a default method with the same signature
                // This class must provide its own implementation to resolve the conflict
                @Override
                public void sayHello() {
                    System.out.println("Hello from MyClass");
                }
            }

        ```

*   What is static method in interface ?

>>  Static methods in interfaces were introduced in Java 8. These methods are declared using the static keyword within an 
    interface and provide utility or helper methods that are related to the interface but don't depend on any specific 
    instance of the implementing class.

    It is to be note that the static method of interface is not inherited by implementing class. Altough, it can have 
    static method with same method signature as of interface.

    Here's an example:

    ```
        interface MyInterface {
            // Static method in an interface
            static void staticMethod() {
                System.out.println("This is a static method in MyInterface");
            }
        }

        // Example of using a static method from the interface
        class MyClass implements MyInterface {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                // Calling the static method from the interface
                MyInterface.staticMethod();
            }
        }
    ```
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is the purpose of static method in interface ?

>>  Reasons for using static methods in interfaces:

    (1) Utility Methods: 
    
        Static methods in interfaces can provide utility functions related to the interface's functionality. These methods 
        can be called directly using the interface name, without requiring an instance of the implementing class.

    (2) Code Organization: 
    
        They aid in organizing code logically within the interface. When a method is closely associated with the interface 
        itself and doesn't rely on any specific instance data, making it static keeps it clearly associated with the interface.
