*   What is Streams ?

>>  In Java, Streams represent a sequence of elements that can be processed in a declarative and functional way. Introduced 
    in Java 8, the Stream API provides a new abstraction to work with collections of objects, allowing concise and efficient 
    manipulation of data.

    Key Characteristics of Streams:

    (1) Sequence of Elements: 
    
        Streams represent a sequence of elements that can come from various sources, including collections, arrays, I/O 
        channels, etc.

    (2) Functional Approach: 
    
        Streams support functional-style operations, enabling developers to express transformations on data without 
        explicitly writing loops or iterations.

    (3) Laziness: 
    
        Stream operations can be lazy or eager. Intermediate operations like filter, map, sorted, etc., are lazily executed, 
        which means they're postponed until a terminal operation triggers them.

    (4) Pipeline Operations: 
    
        Stream operations can be chained together to form pipelines, where the output of one operation feeds as input to 
        another.

    (5) Immutable: 
    
        Streams do not modify the underlying data source. Instead, they produce new streams or collections after 
        performing operations.

*   What are various intermediate methods in streams ?

>>  Intermediate methods perform operations on a stream and return a new stream as the result.

    They're often lazy, meaning they don't execute immediately. Instead, they wait for a terminal operation to trigger 
    the execution.

    Multiple intermediate operations can be chained together to form a pipeline.

    Examples: filter, map, sorted, distinct, limit, skip, etc.

    Let's consider a list of Person objects with attributes like name, age, and gender.

    ```
        class Person {
            private String name;
            private int age;
            private String gender;

            public Person(String name, int age, String gender) {
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
                this.gender = gender;
            }

            // Getters for attributes
            // ...
        }
    ```

    Example List of Persons:

    ```
        List<Person> persons = Arrays.asList(
            new Person("Alice", 25, "Female"),
            new Person("Bob", 30, "Male"),
            new Person("Charlie", 28, "Male"),
            new Person("David", 22, "Male"),
            new Person("Emma", 27, "Female")
        );
    ```

    Examples of Intermediate Operations:

    (1) filter() :
    
        Filters elements based on a provided predicate. It retains only elements that satisfy the given condition. The 
        resultant list might not have same number of elements as initial list.
    
        ```
            // Filter persons older than 25
            List<Person> personsOlderThan25 = persons.stream()
                .filter(person -> person.getAge() > 25)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        ```

    (2) map() :
        
        Transforms each element in the stream using the provided function by performing the operation on the elements. The
        resultant list will have same number of elements as initial list.
    
        ```
            // Map person names to uppercase
            List<String> uppercaseNames = persons.stream()
                .map(person -> person.getName().toUpperCase())
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        ```

    (3) sorted() :

        Sorts elements according to a provided comparator.
    
        ```
            // Sort persons by age in descending order
            List<Person> personsSortedByAgeDesc = persons.stream()
                .sorted((p1, p2) -> Integer.compare(p2.getAge(), p1.getAge()))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        ```
    
    (4) distinct() : Removes duplicate elements from the colection
    
        ```
            // Get distinct gender values
            List<String> distinctGenders = persons.stream()
                .map(Person::getGender)
                .distinct()
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        ```

    (5) limit() :
     
        Limits the amount of elements in the stream to first N numbers.
    
        ```
            // Limit to first 3 persons
            List<Person> firstThreePersons = persons.stream()
                .limit(3)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        ```
    
    (6) skip() :

        Skips the first N elements in the stream

        ```
            // Skip the first 2 persons
            List<Person> skippedPersons = persons.stream()
                .skip(2)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        ```

*   What are various terminal methods in streams ?

>>  Terminal methods produce a result or a side effect and close the stream, triggering its execution.

    They cause the intermediate operations in the pipeline to start processing.

    Examples: collect, forEach, reduce, anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch, etc.

    (1) collect() :
    
        Collects the elements of the stream into a data structure specified by a Collector.

        ```
            // Collect names of persons into a List
            List<String> namesList = persons.stream()
                .map(Person::getName)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        ```

    (2) forEach() :
        
        Performs an action for each element in the stream without returning any result.

        ```
            // Print names of all persons
            persons.stream()
                .map(Person::getName)
                .forEach(System.out::println);
        ```

    (3) count() :

        Counts the number of elements in the stream.

        ```
            // Counts the number of Person aged above 30
            long count = persons.stream()
                    .filter(person -> person.getAge() > 30)
                    .count();
        ```
    
    (4) reduce() :
    
        Performs a reduction on the elements.
            
        ```
            // Calculate total age of all persons using reduce
            int totalAge = persons.stream()
                .map(Person::getAge)
                .reduce(0, Integer::sum);
        ```

    (5) anyMatch(), allMatch(), noneMatch() : 
    
        Checks for certain conditions within the stream and returns boolean value.

        ```
            // Check if any person is older than 30
            boolean anyPersonOlderThan30 = persons.stream()
                .anyMatch(person -> person.getAge() > 30);
        ```

        ```
            // Check if all persons are females
            boolean allPersonsAreFemales = persons.stream()
                .allMatch(person -> person.getGender().equals("Female"));
        ```

        ```
            // Check if none of the persons are younger than 20
            boolean noneYoungerThan20 = persons.stream()
                .noneMatch(person -> person.getAge() < 20);
        ```
    
    (6) toArray():
    
        Collects the elements of the stream into an array.
        
        ```
            Person[] personsAbove30 = persons.stream()
                .filter(person -> person.getAge() > 30)
                .toArray(Person[]::new);
        ```
